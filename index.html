                    The next day, we went on the trek to Katiki Waterfalls. Those moments are still fresh in my mind, like they happened just yesterday. Spending time with you on that trip was one of the best memories I have, and I‚Äôll never forget it.</p>

                    Standing on the rocks, feeling the beach waves around us while holding your hand made me realize how special that moment was. I wanted to express my feelings so badly, but I couldn‚Äôt. Just holding your hand that day made me feel like I was in another world.</p>

                    Sitting beside you and gazing at the moon, I felt something indescribable‚Äîa moment we could only feel together. And do you remember when I laid my head on your shoulder for almost 10 minutes? Those 10 minutes felt like pure heaven, a blissful escape where everything else faded away, and it was just us</p>

But then, in a surprising twist, the security officer allowed us in, and we were treated to a breathtaking view. Standing beside you, I felt like I was in a dream, completely out of this world. Even then, as the beauty of the moment wrapped around us, I wanted to express my love, but the words just wouldn't come.

                    That day was truly special, from our delightful lunch to our visit back to Rose Hill. Even though we didn't stay long there, every second felt precious. I cherished that day with you, holding onto the memories that continue to make my heart smile.</p>

Everyone admired us, and I could sense the whispers, with some wondering if there was something special between us, almost like it was our own little haldi function.

                        I'll never forget that day, especially when I felt a twinge of jealousy as Chatur took photos with you, his hand resting on your shoulder. I stepped away, feeling a mix of emotions, but then you called me back, saying, 'Let‚Äôs take photos.' In that moment, I felt so special to you, as you held my hand like a couple, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that you were telling everyone, "I am his girl."

That was the day you gave me my very first hug. I‚Äôll never forget the moment; we were at the hostel office, and you decided to wrap your arms around me. As soon as you hugged me, something stirred within me. I was stunned, and tears welled up in my eyes‚Äînot from sadness, but from overwhelming happiness.

                        You looked at me, a little surprised, and asked, "You won't hug me back?" In that instant, everything felt right in the world. I wrapped my arms around you, and it felt like time stood still. It was the first time I ever hugged a girl, and I still remember the warmth of your embrace. Every butterfly in my stomach took flight. That hug was more than just a gesture; it was a connection that I had never experienced before.
                        
                        That feeling lingers with me even as I write this. It was the best and most beautiful gift I have ever received in my life‚Äîa moment that made my birthday unforgettable. Thank you for sharing that precious memory with me; it means more than words can express.And do you remember? That night, around 2 AM, I gathered the courage to express my feelings to you.That entire day was special, but your hug was the highlight, marking the beginning of something truly wonderful.</p>

                <p>Akshata, it was March 31st, 2023, a day that became unforgettable in both our lives. That was the day we officially entered into our relationship, a moment that felt like destiny. After the beautiful hug on my birthday, we both realized that just those few moments weren‚Äôt enough. We craved more‚Äîmore hugs, more closeness, and a deeper connection.

                    Our first temple date together felt like a perfect setting for what was about to happen. As we sat on the steps, the world around us faded, and we found ourselves wrapped in each other's arms once again. We hugged tightly for over 25 minutes, feeling the warmth of each other‚Äôs presence. In that moment, I turned to you and, with all my heart, I said, "I‚Äôm sorry," and kissed you on the cheek. The surprise in your eyes made my heart race.
                    
                    Then, after a moment that felt like eternity, you accepted my proposal, and just like that, we were officially together. The happiness was overwhelming, and we hugged again, tighter than before. I found myself saying "sorry" once more, and when you asked why, I simply replied, "Yes, but looking into your eyes, I couldn't resist."
                    
                    With a mix of nervous excitement and pure affection, I kissed you on your lips. It felt like my soul left my body in that instant, and I was lost in the magic of that moment. I half-expected you to slap me for being so bold, but instead, you welcomed me with open arms, and we kissed again, this time for what felt like forever‚Äîalmost 45 minutes.
                    
                    In those moments, as we lost track of time and even became a little dehydrated from the sweetness of it all, I was mesmerized by the beauty in your eyes. You made me forget the entire world around us, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think, "Akshata, you are truly a beautiful woman."
                    
                    I love you for infinity, and that day will forever hold a special place in my heart.</p>

That speaks volumes about your love‚Äîit's truly unconditional.

                    Spending the entire night with you was the greatest gift I could have asked for. But what made it even more precious was the moment when I asked you to sleep on my lap, and you surprised me by saying, ‚ÄúNo, today you sleep on my lap.‚Äù In that instant, my heart swelled, and tears filled my eyes, but I held them back, not wanting to show my vulnerability.
                    
                    That night, resting my head in your lap, I felt like the luckiest person in the world. You are truly the most beautiful woman, inside and out. When we woke up and shared that kiss, it wasn‚Äôt just any kiss; it was a sweet promise of ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù as we welcomed the New Year together.
                    
                    It was a magical night that I‚Äôll forever cherish, and I can‚Äôt help but hope that we‚Äôll create many more New Year‚Äôs memories together in the future.</p>

                <p>Akshata, it was March 31st, 2024, and can you believe it? We‚Äôve celebrated a whole year together! One year with you feels like a beautiful dream, and I‚Äôm so grateful for every moment we‚Äôve shared. But I know I‚Äôve put a lot on your shoulders, and I‚Äôm sorry for that. One year is not nearly enough‚ÄîI want countless days and years with you, side by side, holding each other up.

                    I realize I didn‚Äôt plan our anniversary as beautifully as I should have, and I know that upset you. Back then, I didn‚Äôt understand how to express love and care in the way you deserved. But now, I promise to make you feel like the most cherished woman in the world. This past year has felt like a glimpse of heaven‚Äîfilled with late-night calls, sweet chats, and unforgettable dates. Just thinking about those moments brings tears to my eyes, and I can‚Äôt help but wish for another chance to show you how much you mean to me.
                    
                    I miss you so much, and even though my anniversary plan might not have been perfect, being with you made it special. Every little moment together, no matter how simple, turns into something magical because it‚Äôs you by my side. I regret not expressing my feelings better, but all I need is another chance to shower you with the love and care you truly deserve.
                    
                    Let‚Äôs create more beautiful memories together, Akshata. I love you.</p>

                <h3>Dear Akshata ‚ù§Ô∏è,</h3>
                <p>My dearest, I just wanted to say how much you mean to me. You bring joy and light to my life, and I cherish every moment with you.

                    Every day used to start with your message and end with your call. But now, my day starts with hope and ends with tears. There‚Äôs a void without you, and it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt fill on my own. In a world full of choices, I would still choose you, again and again. No doubts, no second thoughts‚Äîjust a quiet certainty that, even in our hardest moments, you are the one my heart will always pick.
                    
                    I know I wasn‚Äôt the partner you deserved. I know I didn‚Äôt give you the love, care, and attention you needed. And for that, I am deeply sorry. You gave me your unwavering love and loyalty, but I failed to do the same. You stood by me, and I took that for granted. I‚Äôve come to realize that being "perfect" doesn‚Äôt matter, but having true feelings and respect does, and I promise you, my feelings for you have always been real. Even now, they haven‚Äôt changed.
                    
                    I‚Äôll always choose you‚Äîthrough every challenge, every high, and every low. No matter how much you push me away, my love for you remains. I want to be by your side while we both grow and work on ourselves, together. I know life isn‚Äôt easy, but I believe we can face it hand in hand.
                    
                    Everyone gives gifts, but what I can give you is respect, loyalty, time, trust, and priority. You‚Äôll always have me, especially on the bad days when things feel heavy. I want you to know that you are loved deeply, and I‚Äôll always be here to help lift your burdens. I want to see you happy and at peace, without any worries weighing you down.
                    
                    Akshata, I want you to know that I love you. I‚Äôve made so many mistakes, but if you ever feel that love again, I‚Äôll be here. Even after years, no matter how long it takes, I‚Äôll still be waiting for you with the same feelings. You might think the past will repeat itself, but I am determined to give you the happiness and love you deserve this time.
                    
                    I know you‚Äôre preparing for UPSC, and I‚Äôm sure that comes with a lot of stress. I want to be the one who comforts you, who stands by you when things get tough. I want to be there to support you, not just with words, but with actions that show you how much I truly care.
                    
                    I‚Äôve changed, Akshata. I‚Äôm not the person I used to be. And while I know that may be hard to believe, I‚Äôm asking for the chance to prove it to you. Let‚Äôs take things slow, but let‚Äôs start over and rebuild the trust that was lost. I want us to create something beautiful‚Äîsomething stronger, something real.
                    
                    Even now, I miss the simple things, like your messages and your voice. I long for the day I‚Äôll see that double tick on WhatsApp, hoping that maybe, just maybe, you‚Äôll say "Hi" again.
                    
                    I love you, and I‚Äôll love you forever. I‚Äôm waiting for you, always.
                    
                    Yours,
                    Hemanth</p>
